# Data Structures Practice

Welcome to the **DataStructuresPractice** repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and understanding fundamental data structures using C and C++.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find various implementations of common data structures using C and C++. Each data structure is implemented with a focus on clarity and understanding. The goal is not only to provide working implementations but also to help you grasp the underlying concepts of each data structure.

## Data Structures Included

Currently, the repository covers the following data structures:

- **Linked List**: Implementation of singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure using arrays and linked lists.
- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary trees along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Graph**: Implementation of graph data structures and algorithms like BFS and DFS.
